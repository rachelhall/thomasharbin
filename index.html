                <p><span id="quote">&#8220;</span> A strong emphasis on practical music theory enables students to be equally capable at reading music and playing by ear. This inspires creativity and equips students to excel as soloists as well as playing along with other musicians.<span id="quote">&#8221;</span></p>

                        <p>Parents of younger students are expected to attend lessons in order to learn how much his or her child should be practicing and how best to encourage a young music student.

                                Students should aim to practices at least five days per week. A long practice the night before a lesson is not as effective is steady practice throughout the week.</p>
